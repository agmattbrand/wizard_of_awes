  # Wizard Of Awes will automatically call this method
  # in a before filter of the content editor controller actions to
  # ensure that there is a currently logged in helper user.
  #
  # Also, if the user is a helper user, any helper snippets will have quick edit links
  #
  # This setting changes the method which Wizard Of Awes calls
  # within the controller.
  #
  # If this is not specified, nobody will be able to add snippets
  #
  # It needs to have two methods:
  # 
  # Method #1: 'woa_authorize' ## This should return true if the user is ok or redirect if they aren't
  # Method #2: 'is_helper_user?' ## This should return true if the user is ok or false if they aren't
  #
  # config.helper_auth = 'WizardOfAwes::HelperAuth'

  # Default url to access admin area is http://yourhost/woa-snippets/
  # You can change 'woa-snippets' to anything you want. To disable this area
  # entirely set this to '' or nil
  # config.snippet_route_prefix = 'woa-snippets'
