  # Also, if the user is a helper user, any helper snippets will have quick edit links
  #
  # This setting changes the method which Wizard Of Awes calls
  # within the controller.

  # If this is not specified, nobody will be able to add snippets

  # It needs to have one method:
  # 
  # 'woa_authorize' ## This should return true if the user is ok or redirect if they aren't
